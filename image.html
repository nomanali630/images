<p>The Kartarpur Corridor (Punjabi (Gurmukhi):  is a visa-free border crossing and secure corridor,[1][2] connecting the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan to the border with India.[3][4][5][6] The crossing allows Sikh devotees from India to visit the gurdwara in Kartarpur, 4.7 kilometres (2.9 miles) from the India–Pakistan border without a visa, creating a link which allows pilgrims holding Indian passports to easily visit both the Kartarpur shrine and Gurdwara Dera Baba Nanak on the Indian side of the border.[7] Pakistani Sikhs are unable to use the border crossing, and cannot access the site without first obtaining an Indian visa or unless they work there.[8]</p>
<h1>Minar e Pakistan:</h1>

<p>Minar-e-Pakistan  is a national monument located in Lahore, Pakistan.[1] The tower was built between 1960 and 1968 on the site where the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution on 23 March 1940 - the first official call for a separate and independent homeland for the Muslims of British India, as espoused by the two-nation theory. The resolution eventually helped lead to the emergence of an independent Pakistani state in 1947.</p>
